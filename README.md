### Video Games Sales Data Analysis 

#### Project Overview
This project aims to analyze video games sales data and derive valuable insights and recommendations.
I have answered the following questions using data analysis and visualizations in Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn): 

1. Which region had the most sales?
2. Which year had the most sales?
3. Which platforms acquire the most market share? 
4. Are there platform preferences in certain regions?
5. Are there genre preferences in certain regions?
6. Which are the biggest publishers? 

#### Dataset
The data used in this analysis is from Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales. It can also be downloaded from this repository. 

#### Insights
1. North America is, by far, the biggest consumer of video games!
2. Video gaming was very popular in 2008 and 2009 but has fallen in popularity since then. It may be interesting to conduct further analysis of activities that have gained popularity and why. 
3. PS2 is the most popular gaming platform globally. PS3 and X360 are pretty popular as well. Wii is another popular platform in North America but DS seems to be the most popular in Japan.
4. The most popular genre is 'Action'. However, 'Role-Playing', is by far, the most popular video game genre in Japan. Marketing efforts may be focused on 'Role-Playing' games in Japan. 
5. The biggest video games publisher is 'Electronic Arts'. 'Acitivision', 'Namco Bandai Games' and 'Ubisoft', all share a similar market share in second place.
